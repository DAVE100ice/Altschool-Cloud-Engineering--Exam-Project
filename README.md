 - [What is the repository all about ]()


   - Laravel - Laravel is a popular PHP web application framework that is often used in conjunction with the LAMP stack to build web applications.
  
     
   - Lamp stack - The LAMP stack is a software bundle that includes Linux as the operating system, Apache as the web server
  
     
   - The Master and slave - This is used to Setup or Automate he provisioning of two Ubuntu-based servers which is *Master* and *Slave*
  
     
   - Ansible - ansible is a valuable tool for anyone looking to streamline infrastructure management, improve efficiency, and ensure consistency in configuration and deployment processes.


 - [Explaining different sections in the repository]()


   - Ansible-Playbook - So Inside ansible we have a files directory and inside that file directory there is another file inside this file is called Laravel-slave.sh and still inside this ansible we have the **ansible.cfg**, we have the *inventory* and *site-yaml*, what the ansible.cfg does is that it's just hold the configuration of ansible, and also for Inventory it does hold the tagret machine ip address which is the (slave machine), and the site-yaml what it's does is that it's copys the cron job , it's copys the file , it's change the command of the file , it's runs or executes laravel script  


   - laravel-slave.sh - This file basically install the whole laravel application and deploys the laravel application with Lamp (Linux, Apache, MYSQL, PHP)


   - Bash.sh - So this just spins up our *Master* and ***Slave*** Machine


   - Laravel-Master.sh - It's Basically helps us run or deploy laravel on the ***Master*** *Node*
 

 - [How to run the Repository]()


    - this script is very readable and reuseable because of that it is flexible.
      
  
    - The laravel-master.sh file is to run when the master machine is up


    - To run this script you will need to consider just 4 things


       1. MYSQL Database
       2. .ENV (laravel file)
       3. Ansible.config file


      [MYSQL]()


      - Due to the fact that we are using parameters to create a database while running the script you will need just 2 *arguments*:
  
     
      -  ````bash
         ./laravel-master.sh  David12345 Estherubi
         ````


      - The 1st Arg is for the DB_USERNAME and DB_DATABASE
     

      - The 2nd Arg is for the DB_PASSWORD
     

      - **NOTE** : Whatever username and password you are using it must align with the username and password in the .env file 
     

      [.ENV](github.com/laravel)


      - Since everything is running automatically we will also need to change the .env file
     

      - `````bash
         sudo sed -i -b 's/DB_DATABASE=laravel/DB_DATABASE=David12345/' /var/www/html/laravel/.env
         sudo sed -i -b 's/DB_USERNAME=laravel/DB_USERNAME=David12345/' /var/www/html/laravel/.env
         sudo sed -i -b 's/DB_PASSWORD=/DB_PASSWORD=Estherubi/' /var/www/html/laravel/.env
        ````


      - Make sure this three lines Correspond with the Arg you will be adding while running the script.
     

      [Ansible.config file]()


        - in the ***laravel-master.sh*** file there is a section for the ansible config file
          
       
        - in this path all you will need to chamge is the [*ServerName*]() and the will changing this to the domain name or ip address of the server you want to run the script on.
     
       
        -  if you have all this set then you are ready to run the script like i showed you how.
